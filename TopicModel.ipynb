      "Topic 0:\nexpress cell gene cancer\nConnexin 31 (Cx31) is considered a suppressor for many tumors. Ginsenoside (Rg1) is a traditional Chinese herb that is widely acknowledged due to its anti-tumor characteristics. However, limited studies have focused on the role of Rg1 in papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) cells. In the current study, we found that the expression of Cx31 in thyroid cancer tissues and thyroid cancer cell lines was significantly lower than that in normal thyroid epithelial tissues and cell lines. Overexpression of Cx31 reduced thyroid cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Furthermore, we found that Rg1 significantly enhanced the expression of Cx31. Moreover, the proliferation and migration of IHH-4 and BCPAP cells were significantly reduced by Rg1 treatment. In contrast, the silencing of Cx31 enhanced the expression of Ki67 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). Meanwhile, treatment with Rg1 significantly decreased the protein levels of Ki67 and PCNA, but these effects could be abolished by transfection with si-Cx31. In summary, we provide novel evidence that the expression of Cx31 was decreased in thyroid cancer cells, but Rg1 treatment could significantly enhance the expression of Cx31 thereby suppressing thyroid cancer cell proliferation and migration.\nThe hepatic cells are characteristic cells that occur in millipede body where they form a continuous layer which surrounds the midgut epithelium. The following species, which represent five millipede orders were selected: Julus scandinavius (Julida), Polyxenus lagurus (Polyxenida), Polydesmus angustus (Polydesmida, Polydesmidae), Strongylosoma stigmatosum (Polydesmida, Paradoxosomatidae), Epibolus pulchripes (Spirobolida, Pachybolidae), and two species of the order Spirostreptida, Archispirostreptus gigas and Telodeinopus aoutii. The hepatic cells are absent in P. lagurus in which the midgut epithelium is surrounded by the visceral muscles. In the other species they were arranged around the midgut as coherent hepatic cells of mesenchymal character. Each hepatic cell possessed its own basal lamina and formed the cellular processes which protrude into the basal lamina of the midgut to make contact with midgut digestive cells. Accumulation of reserve material in different millipede taxa has been described with the special emphasis on the process of autophagy in the cytoplasm of the hepatic cells. The lack of hepatic cells may represent an ancestral condition within millipedes.\nThis study investigated the effects of Golgi membrane protein 73 (GP73) on the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and on bladder cancer cell invasion and metastasis through the TGF-β1/Smad2 signalling pathway. Paired bladder cancer and adjacent tissue samples (102) and normal bladder tissue samples (106) were obtained. Bladder cancer cell lines (T24, 5637, RT4, 253J and J82) were selected and assigned to blank, negative control (NC), TGF-β, thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), TGF-β1+ TSP-1, GP73-siRNA-1, GP73-siRNA-2, GP73-siRNA-1+ TSP-1, GP73-siRNA-1+ pcDNA-GP73, WT1-siRNA and WT1-siRNA + GP73-siRNA-1 groups. Expressions of GP73, TGF-β1, Smad2, p-Smad2, E-cadherin and vimentin were detected using RT-qPCR and Western blotting. Cell proliferation, migration and invasion were determined using MTT assay, scratch testing and Transwell assay, respectively. Compared with the blank and NC groups, levels of GP73, TGF-β1, Smad2, p-Smad2, N-cadherin and vimentin decreased, and levels of WT1 and E-cadherin increased in the GP73-siRNA-1 and GP73-siRNA-2 groups, while the opposite results were observed in the WT1 siRNA, TGF-β, TSP-1 and TGF-β + TSP-1 groups. Cell proliferation, migration and invasion notably decreased in the GP73-siRNA-1 and GP73-siRNA-2 groups in comparison with the blank and NC groups, while in the WT1 siRNA, TGF-β, TSP-1 and TGF-β + TSP-1 groups, cell migration, invasion and proliferation showed the reduction after the EMT. These results suggest that GP73 promotes bladder cancer invasion and metastasis by inducing the EMT through down-regulating WT1 levels and activating the TGF-β1/Smad2 signalling pathway.\nIncreasing evidence has suggested that Capn4 is upregulated and functions as a potential tumor promoter in several human cancer types. However, the potential biological roles and regulatory mechanisms of Capn4 in colorectal cancer (CRC) remains unclear. Here, we found that Capn4 expression was elevated in CRC tissues than adjacent noncancerous tissues. Additionally, we also found that overexpression of Capn4 is significantly correlated with tumor progression and poor survival in CRC patients. Furthermore, our experimental data revealed that increased expression of Capn4 was observed in CRC cell lines and ectopic expression of Capn4 significantly enhanced in vitro cell proliferation, whereas knockdown of Capn4 suppressed CRC cells growth in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, our results indicate that Capn4 promotes cell proliferation by increasing MAPK7 expression, which has been reported to control the proliferation of many cancers. Mechanistically, Capn4 upregulates MAPK7 expression through activation of the Wnt/β-Catenin pathway in CRC cells. Therefore, we identified a tumorigenic role of Capn4 in CRC and suggested a potential therapeutic target for CRC patients.\nTopic 1:\nwind fault bacteria bacteri\nAeolian dust particles arising from arid and semiarid zones are known to carry microbes by air currents. The effect of wind-borne bacteria on atmospheric bacterial population at various downwind distances from the dust source regions must be clarified, but has not yet been reported. This study monitored the bacterial abundance and community composition in outdoor aerosol samples in Beijing, China, which is close to the Asian dust source regions, and compared them with the results obtained in a distant region (Osaka, Japan). The Asian dust collected in Beijing contained (4±3)×104 bacterial cells/m3, approximately 4 times higher than in Osaka. On 15 April 2015, Beijing experienced severe Asian dust events with a 1000-fold increase in bacterial abundance, relative to non-Asian dust days. Dominant bacterial phyla and classes in Asian dust collected in Beijing were Actinobacteria, Bacilli and Acidobacteria, and the bacterial community composition varied more widely than in Osaka. The bacterial community compositions differed between the Beijing and Osaka dusts, even for the same Asian dust events. These results indicated that aerosol bacterial communities nearer the dust source are more affected by eolian dust than their distant counterparts.\nThe Pieniny Klippen Belt (PKB) is a narrow structure delineating the boundary between the Central and Outer Carpathians. It is built of nappes stacked during the Cretaceous and Paleocene and then re-folded in the Miocene during the formation of the Outer Carpathian overthrusts. The internal structure of the PKB at the Polish/Slovakian border first formed during northward nappe thrusting processes, which were most intense at the turn of the Cretaceous to the Paleocene. A secondary factor is the change in strike of the PKB turning from W–E to WNW–ESE, associated with dextral strike-slip faulting in the Carpathian basement (North-European Platform). These NNW-SSE oriented strike-slip fault zones, broadly parallel to the Teisseyre-Tornquist Zone, are responsible for the segmentation of the down-going plate, which influenced the subduction and collision between the North-European Platform and the Central Carpathian Block. Among them, the most important role was played by the Kraków—Myszków Fault Zone separating the Małopolska and Upper Silesian blocks in the Carpathian foreland. Shifts and interactions between the neighboring Pieniny and Outer Carpathian basins—during contemporaneous sedimentation and deformation—resulted in a difficult-to-define, transitional zone. Until now this zone had the rank of a tectonic unit, named “Grajcarek Unit” in Poland and “Šariš Unit” in the Slovak Republic. However, its northern boundary, often taken to represent the Central/Outer Carpathians boundary, is ambiguous. These problems are due to the spatial overlap of thrusting and gravitational flows resulting in chaotic breccias, olistoliths and olistostrome formation, which formed repeatedly and became deformed during the Maastrichtian to Early Miocene. Tectonic deformations in this area gradually vanished towards the north. This zone can therefore be defined as the Peri-Klippen part of the Magura Nappe that lacks a distinct northern tectonic limit. For this reason it is named Šariš Transitional Zone (ŠTZ).\nBackground/purpose: Bacterial infection is closely associated with the failure of endodontic treatment, and use of endodontic sealer with antimicrobial activity and biological compatibility is necessary for the success of root canal treatment. The purpose of this study was to investigate and to compare the antibacterial effect of two calcium silicate-based root canal sealers (Endoseal and EndoSequence BC sealer) as recent development sealers and with three conventional root canal sealers (AH Plus, Sealapex, and Tubli-Seal), before or after setting, on Porphyromonas endodontalis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Enterococcus faecalis. Materials and methods: The sealers were soaked in phosphate buffered saline to elute its compositions after and before setting, and the elutes were performed the antimicrobial assay. Also, X-ray fluorescence analysis was carried out to compare compositions of two calcium silicate-based sealers. Results: The conventional root canal sealers have strong antibacterial activity against the Gram-negative bacteria, P. endodontalis and P. gingivalis. Endoseal sealer showed antibacterial activity against not only the Gram-negative bacteria, but also against the Gram-positive bacteria, E. faecalis. However, Endosequence BC sealer exhibited a weak antibacterial effect on all bacteria in this study. X-ray fluorescence analysis exhibited that Endoseal contained more types and more amount of the oxide compound known to have strong antimicrobial activity such as Al2O3, Fe2O3, MgO, Na2O, NiO, and SO2 than Endoseqeunce BC. Conclusion: Endoseal, which contains various types of oxide compounds, seems to be a suitable sealer for preventing bacterial infection in both treated and untreated root canals.\nHigh sound pressure levels (>120. dB) cause damage or death of the hair cells of the inner ear, hence causing hearing loss. Vocalization differences are present between hens and roosters. Crowing in roosters is reported to produce sound pressure levels of 100. dB measured at a distance of 1. m. In this study we measured the sound pressure levels that exist at the entrance of the outer ear canal. We hypothesize that roosters may benefit from a passive protective mechanism while hens do not require such a mechanism. Audio recordings at the level of the entrance of the outer ear canal of crowing roosters, made in this study, indeed show that a protective mechanism is needed as sound pressure levels can reach amplitudes of 142.3. dB. Audio recordings made at varying distances from the crowing rooster show that at a distance of 0.5. m sound pressure levels already drop to 102. dB. Micro-CT scans of a rooster and chicken head show that in roosters the auditory canal closes when the beak is opened. In hens the diameter of the auditory canal only narrows but does not close completely. A morphological difference between the sexes in shape of a bursa-like slit which occurs in the outer ear canal causes the outer ear canal to close in roosters but not in hens.\nTopic 2:\nglucos diabet obes barrier\nZusammenfassung: Vor 75 Jahren wurde ein Verfahren zur Faserherstellung aus Polyacrylnitril aufgefunden. Nahezu gleichzeitig und unabhängig voneinander kamen der Deutsche Herbert Rein bei der IG Farbenindustrie und der Amerikaner Ryde C. Houtz bei der Firma Du Pont zu dem Ergebnis, dass Polyacrylnitril aus Lösungen in Dimethylformamid zu Fasern verarbeitet werden kann. Unter dem Markennamen Orlon brachte Du Pont 1950 die erste Polyacrilnitrilfaser auf den Markt. In Deutschland, wo die Entwicklung durch den Zweiten Weltkrieg gehemmt worden war, kamen Polyacrylnitrilfasern zwei Jahre später in den Handel. Für einige spezielle Einsatzgebiete haben sich diese Fasern in den zurück liegenden Jahren auf dem textilen Rohstoffmarkt einen festen Platz erobert.\nDas bioliq®-Verfahren wurde am Karlsruher Institut für Technologie (KIT) zur Herstellung von synthetischen Kraftstoffen aus Restbiomasse entwickelt. Das mehrstufige Verfahren berücksichtigt sowohl die dezentrale Verfügbarkeit von Biomasse als auch die Notwendigkeit einer großtechnischen Synthese von Kraftstoffen. Der gesamte Prozess wird im Pilotmaßstab am KIT betrieben. Der Hochdruckflugstromvergaser, von Air Liquide Global E&C Solutions, wandelt die in einer Schnellpyrolyse vorbehandelte Biomasse in Synthesegas um, das in der anschließenden Synthese zur Benzinproduktion eingesetzt wird. Erste Ergebnisse der Anlage werden präsentiert.\nEimeria maricopensis n. sp. (Apicomplexa: Eimeriidae) is described from 2 of 15 (13%) Arizona cotton rats Sigmodon arizonae Mearns in Arizona, USA. Sporulated oöcysts of this new species are ovoidal to ellipsoidal, 20–28 × 16–22 (24.9 × 19.2) µm, with a smooth, bi-layered wall; both micropyle and oöcyst residuum are absent, but fragmented polar granule material is present. Sporocysts are ellipsoidal, 11–14 × 6–8 (12.9 × 7.0) µm, with a Stieda body, sub-Stieda body, and sporocyst residuum; sporozoites are elongate with a spheroidal anterior refractile body and a subspheroidal posterior refractile body. In addition, sporulated oöcysts of Eimeria sigmodontis Barnard, Ernst & Dixon, 1974, Eimeria tuskegeensis Barnard, Ernst & Dixon, 1974 and Eimeria webbae Barnard, Ernst & Dixon, 1974 are described from S. arizonae. This is the first report on the coccidia of S. arizonae.\nTuta absoluta (Meyrick) (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae) is classified as one of the most harmful pest of tomato crops. Many species of predators and parasitoids including Trichogramma cacoeciae (Marchal) (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae) are noted as potential candidates used for biological control of this pest. Therefore, the use of selective insecticides is critical to conserve and protect natural enemies in the field. This study assessed the side effects of insecticides on different development stages of T. cacoeciae under laboratory conditions. For this, eleven pesticides such as: Indoxacarb, spiromesifen, cyromazin, chlorfenapyr, cypermethrin, diafenthiuron, chlorantraniliprole, spinosad, azadirachtin, Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) and virus HaNPV were tested. This study shows that indoxacarb, spiromesifen, chlorfenapyr, cypermethrin, diafenthiuron and spinosad had a negative effect on immature stages of Trichogramma. All insecticides residues on tomato leaves were found to be toxic to Trichogramma adults except azadirachtin, Bt and virus HaNPV. Therefore, the use of the tested natural products (azadirachtin, Bt and HaNPV) at the recommended doses is viable, having no negative impact on T. cacoeciae in tomato crops.\nTopic 3:\ncancer treatment patient clinic\nProstate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission tomography–computed tomography (PET-CT) imaging for the localization of prostate cancer is increasingly available in Germany. The advances and limitations in different disease stages are reviewed. As the clinical relevance of oligometastatic disease in primary cancer detected by PSMA PET-CT imaging is not yet completely understood, it should only be used in clinical trials. In recurrent prostate cancer after therapy with curative intent, PSMA PET-CT shows encouraging potential for the planning of salvage therapy. In metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer evidence for its use is not available.\nWe report a 65-year-old male with histopathologically proven prostate cancer and multiple pelvic node metastases using a robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy procedure plus extended pelvic lymph node dissection. Positron emission tomography (PET) scan findings demonstrated a moderate accumulation of 11C-choline in a metastatic left obturator node sized 8 × 8 mm, though only a faint uptake of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) was noted. 11C-choline PET/computed tomography (CT) may be useful for the diagnosis of a tiny metastatic lymph node not demonstrated by CT, magnetic resonance imaging, or FDG-PET/CT and to determine the need for an extended pelvic lymph node dissection.\nIntraoral extranodal Hodgkin's lymphoma is rare. We present the case of a 66-year-old gentleman who was treated for necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis of the UR6 tooth by his dentist which failed to resolve. Biopsy and histopathology revealed that this was, in fact, a rare presentation of primary (Stage I) extranodal oral Hodgkin's lymphoma. We present this case, and a review of the relevant literature.\nBackground: Necrobiotic xanthogranuloma (NXG) is a rare non-Langerhans histiocytosis with cutaneous manifestations, most commonly of the periorbital skin, and is often associated with hematologic disorders such as monoclonal gammopathy. Treatment of NXG is notoriously difficult, and fraught with recurrence and progression. Case Presentation: The authors describe a case of NXG with periorbital involvement in a patient with a complex autoimmune and hematologic medical history. The biopsy of this rare lesion prompted subsequent evaluation for an underlying disorder, which led to the diagnosis of multiple myeloma. Her NXG lesions demonstrated remarkable clinical improvement after treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). Conclusions: This case demonstrates the ophthalmologist’s critical role in the diagnosis and management of NXG, as early detection cannot only prevent ophthalmic consequences such as ocular perforation and blindness, but also prompt further investigation that may reveal an underlying disorder or systemic involvement, including hematologic malignancy as in this case. NXG has been effectively treated with IVIG in a handful of reported cases. To the author’s knowledge, this is the third case of periorbital NXG successfully treated with IVIG, and the first in the ophthalmic literature.\nTopic 4:\ncell activ protein effect\nAutophagy is a self-eating cellular catabolic pathway, through which long-lived proteins, damaged organelles and misfolded proteins are degraded and recycled for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis and normal cellular functions. Autophagy plays an important homeostatic role in the regulation of cell survival. Accumulating evidence shows that autophagy is activated in various cell types in the brain such as neurons, glia cells, and brain microvascular cells upon ischemic stroke. However, the exact role and molecular mechanisms of autophagy process that is implicated in ischemic stroke have yet to be elucidated. This review aims to provide a comprehensive view of the regulation of autophagy in neurons, glia cells, and brain microvascular cells in response to ischemia stress. We also review the recent advance on the understanding of the involvement of autophagy in the pathological process during cerebral ischemic preconditioning, perconditioning and postconditioning. We propose a crosstalk between autophagy, necroptosis, and apoptosis that contribute to ischemic stroke. In addition, we discuss the interactions between autophagy and oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and endoplasmic reticulum stress.\nParkinson's disease is a common age-related neurodegenerative disorder affecting 10 million people worldwide, but the mechanisms underlying its pathogenesis are still unclear. The disease is characterised by dopamine nerve cell loss in the mid-brain and intra-cellular accumulation of α-synuclein that results in motor and non-motor dysfunction. In this review, we discuss the neuroprotective effects of the stomach hormone, ghrelin, in models of Parkinson's disease. Recent findings suggest that it may modulate mitochondrial function and autophagic clearance of impaired organelle in response to changes in cellular energy balance. We consider the putative cellular mechanisms underlying ghrelin-action and the possible role of ghrelin mimetics in slowing or preventing Parkinson's disease progression.\nRegulation of cell division requires the integration of signals implicated in chromatin reorganization and coordination of its sequential changes in mitosis. Vaccinia-related kinase 1 (VRK1) and Aurora B (AURKB) are two nuclear kinases involved in different steps of cell division. We have studied whether there is any functional connection between these two nuclear kinases, which phosphorylate histone H3 in Thr3 and Ser10, respectively. VRK1 and AURKB are able to form a stable protein complex, which represents only a minor subpopulation of each kinase within the cell and is detected following nocodazole release. Each kinase is able to inhibit the kinase activity of the other kinase, as well as inhibit their specific phosphorylation of histone H3. In locations where the two kinases interact, there is a different pattern of histone modifications, indicating that there is a local difference in chromatin during mitosis because of the local complexes formed by these kinases and their asymmetric intracellular distribution. Depletion of VRK1 downregulates the gene expression of BIRC5 (survivin) that recognizes H3-T3ph, both are dependent on the activity of VRK1, and is recovered with kinase active murine VRK1, but not with a kinase-dead protein. The H3–Thr3ph–survivin complex is required for AURB recruitment, and their loss prevents the localization of ACA and AURKB in centromeres. The cross inhibition of the kinases at the end of mitosis might facilitate the formation of daughter cells. A sequential role for VRK1, AURKB, and haspin in the progression of mitosis is proposed.\nDuring development of the central nervous system not all axons are myelinated, and axons may have distinct myelination patterns. Furthermore, the number of myelin sheaths formed by each oligodendrocyte is highly variable. However, our current knowledge about the axo-glia communication that regulates the formation of myelin sheaths spatially and temporally is limited. By using axon-mimicking microfibers and a zebrafish model system, we show that axonal ephrin-A1 inhibits myelination. Ephrin-A1 interacts with EphA4 to activate the ephexin1-RhoA-Rock-myosin 2 signaling cascade and causes inhibition of oligodendrocyte process extension. Both in myelinating co-cultures and in zebrafish larvae, activation of EphA4 decreases myelination, whereas myelination is increased by inhibition of EphA4 signaling at different levels of the pathway, or by receptor knockdown. Mechanistically, the enhanced myelination is a result of a higher number of myelin sheaths formed by each oligodendrocyte, not an increased number of mature cells. Thus, we have identified EphA4 and ephrin-A1 as novel negative regulators of myelination. Our data suggest that activation of an EphA4-RhoA pathway in oligodendrocytes by axonal ephrin-A1 inhibits stable axo-glia interaction required for generating a myelin sheath.\nTopic 5:\nuse model data studi\nBackground: Currently there is no reliable, standardized mechanism to support health care professionals during the evaluation of and procurement processes for simulators. A tool founded on best practices could facilitate simulator purchase processes. Methods: In a 3-phase process, we identified top factors considered during the simulator purchase process through expert consensus (n = 127), created the Simulator Value Index (SVI) tool, evaluated targeted validity evidence, and evaluated the practical value of this SVI. A web-based survey was sent to simulation professionals. Participants (n = 79) used the SVI and provided feedback. We evaluated the practical value of 4 tool variations by calculating their sensitivity to predict a preferred simulator. Results: Seventeen top factors were identified and ranked. The top 2 were technical stability/reliability of the simulator and customer service, with no practical differences in rank across institution or stakeholder role. Full SVI variations predicted successfully the preferred simulator with good (87%) sensitivity, whereas the sensitivity of variations in cost and customer service and cost and technical stability decreased (≤54%). The majority (73%) of participants agreed that the SVI was helpful at guiding simulator purchase decisions, and 88% agreed the SVI tool would help facilitate discussion with peers and leadership. Conclusion: Our findings indicate the SVI supports the process of simulator purchase using a standardized framework. Sensitivity of the tool improved when factors extend beyond traditionally targeted factors. We propose the tool will facilitate discussion amongst simulation professionals dealing with simulation, provide essential information for finance and procurement professionals, and improve the long-term value of simulation solutions. Limitations and application of the tool are discussed.\nThe effort required to listen to and understand noisy speech is an important factor in the evaluation of noise reduction schemes. This paper introduces a model for Listening Effort prediction from Acoustic Parameters (LEAP). The model is based on methods from automatic speech recognition, specifically on performance measures that quantify the degradation of phoneme posteriorgrams produced by a deep neural net: Noise or artifacts introduced by speech enhancement often result in a temporal smearing of phoneme representations, which is measured by comparison of phoneme vectors. This procedure does not require a priori knowledge about the processed speech, and is therefore single-ended. The proposed model was evaluated using three datasets of noisy speech signals with listening effort ratings obtained from normal hearing and hearing impaired subjects. The prediction quality was compared to several baseline models such as the ITU-T standard P.563 for single-ended speech quality assessment, the American National Standard ANIQUE+ for single-ended speech quality assessment, and a single-ended SNR estimator. In all three datasets, the proposed new model achieved clearly better prediction accuracies than the baseline models; correlations with subjective ratings were above 0.9. So far, the model is trained on the specific noise types used in the evaluation. Future work will be concerned with overcoming this limitation by training the model on a variety of different noise types in a multi-condition way in order to make it generalize to unknown noise types.\nIn this paper, a novel control design strategy based on a hybrid model predictive control in combination with fuzzy logic control is presented for a quadrotor helicopter system. In the proposed scheme, a 2-part control structure is used. In the first part, a linear model predictive controller with receding horizon design strategy is combined with a nonlinear model predictive controller, which is applied as the main controller. In the second part, a 2-level fuzzy logic controller is utilized to assist the first controller when the error exceeds a predefined value. The proposed nonlinear predictive control method utilizes a novel approach in which a prediction of the future outputs is used in the modeling stage. Using this simple technique, the problem can be solved using linear methods and, thereby, due to considerable reduction in the computational cost, it will be applicable for the systems with fast dynamics. Moreover, the fuzzy logic controller is used as a supervisor to adjust a proportional-integral-derivative controller to enhance the system performance by decreasing the tracking error. The proposed scheme is applied to a model of quadrotor system such that the difference between the predicted output of the system and the reference value is minimized while there are some constraints on inputs and outputs of the nonlinear quadrotor system. Simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed control scheme for the quadrotor system model.\nStochastic models in hydrology traditionally aim at reproducing the empirically derived statistical characteristics of the observed data rather than any specific distribution model that attempts to describe the usually non-Gaussian statistical behavior of the associated processes. SPARTA (Stochastic Periodic AutoRegressive To Anything) offers an alternative and novel approach which allows the explicit representation of each process of interest with any distribution model, while simultaneously establishes dependence patterns that cannot be fully captured by the typical linear stochastic schemes. Cornerstone of the proposed approach is the Nataf joint-distribution model, which is related with the Gaussian copula, combined with Gaussian periodic autoregressive processes. In order to obtain the target stochastic structure, we have also developed a computationally simple and efficient algorithm, based on a hybrid Monte-Carlo procedure that is used to approximate the required equivalent correlation coefficients. Theoretical and practical benefits of the proposed method, contrasted to outcomes from widely used stochastic models, are demonstrated by means of real-world as well as hypothetical monthly simulation examples involving both univariate and multivariate time series.\nTopic 6:\nspeci fish popul divers\nThis paper deals with species of the deep-water marine lobsters and lithodids collected on soft and rocky bottoms during the four Spanish Maurit surveys from 2007 to 2010 in Mauritanian waters, at depths between 80 and 2000 m. The collection is represented by eight species included in the infraorders Astacidea, Achelata, and Polychelida, and by five species of the family Lithodidae. The true lobster Nephropsis atlantica, the blind lobster Stereomastis nana, and the king crab Paralomis cristulata are reported for the first time in Mauritanian waters, while the presence of the slipper lobster Scyllarus subarctus is confirmed in the area. New data on the bathymetric distribution of P. cristulata and Lithodes ferox are also included.\nDeep-sea sponge grounds are relatively understudied ecosystems that may provide key habitats for a large number of fish and invertebrates including commercial species. Glass sponge grounds have been discovered from the tropics to polar regions but there are only a few places with high densities of dictyonine sponges. Dictyonine glass sponges have a fused skeleton, which stays intact when they die and in some areas the accumulation of successive generations of sponges leads to the formation of reefs. In 2010 and 2016, we surveyed an area near Grays Canyon in Washington, USA, where dense aggregations of glass sponges and potential sponge reefs were discovered in 2007. Our primary aims were to make a preliminary assessment of whether the glass sponges form reefs at this location, characterize the sponge assemblage present at this site and examine associations between the sponges and commercially important species. Multibeam mapping and sub-bottom profiling indicate that the glass sponges at this site do not form reefs and are mostly attached to hard substrates. Analysis of photographs collected by an autonomous underwater vehicle and samples collected by a remotely operated vehicle guided by telepresence revealed the presence of two abundant dictyonine sponge species at this site, Heterochone calyx and Aphrocallistes vastus (mean densities = 1.43 ± 0.057 per 10m2, max = 24 per 10m2). We also observed a large number of non-reef-building glass sponges and various demosponges including a potentially new species in the genus Acarnus. A diverse fish assemblage was recorded at this site including eight species of rockfish. Rockfish abundance was positively related to sponge abundance. Spot prawns (Pandalus platyceros) were also abundant and were strongly associated with sponges. Despite not finding sponge reefs, this is an ecologically significant area. Further research is necessary to determine the environmental factors that give rise to the abundance of large dictyonine sponges at this location and also to determine if other similar sponge grounds exist along the west coast of the United States.\nA ∼42 m section of Late Cretaceous Upper Campanian sediments in Saskatchewan Landing Provincial Park, southwestern Saskatchewan, Canada, represents the easternmost outcrop of the Dinosaur Park Formation in the Western Interior Basin. Herein we document a new microvertebrate locality from the upper part of this formation that shows high diversity in a mixed coastal and marine assemblage. Palynology, ichnology, sedimentology, and vertebrate palaeontology are integrated to determine paleoenvironmental and paleoecological conditions in the region. The site is interpreted as having been deposited under marginal-marine conditions near a shoreline undergoing transgression by the encroaching Bearpaw Sea. Though well studied and sampled in Alberta, the Dinosaur Park Formation is poorly exposed with little known associated vertebrate assemblages in Saskatchewan. These discoveries from the new microvertebrate site offer new insights into Late Cretaceous ecosystems near paleocoastlines, allowing for future studies of spatial diversity patterns relative to Albertan faunas. Herein is also presented the first published occurrences of several Late Campanian vertebrate taxa in Saskatchewan.\nMorphological revision of Fulvifomes robiniae, as well as phylogenetic inferences based on nITS and nLSU markers, indicated that the species has a narrower concept in its morphology and distribution. Other morphologically related taxa arise from this taxonomic approach. Fulvifomes cedrelae is not accepted as a synonym of F. robiniae, and Fulvifomes squamosus sp. nov. is described as new based on Peruvian specimens. Based on morphology, phylogenetic relationships and host distributions, the taxonomic implication for the genus and other related taxa are discussed.\nTopic 7:\nmir sediment isotop deposit\nLake Vrana in Dalmatia is a coastal karstic brackish water environment characterized by a high species richness of ostracods that evolved into their current morphologies during the Holocene. The results of this study reveal five ostracod zones within an 11 m sediment core taken from the central part of the lake. This sedimentary sequence reveals significant changes in both depositional and environmental conditions at local and regional scales; the oldest freshwater deposits, interpreted as the Late Pleistocene/Holocene transition, mainly comprise the species Candona neglecta, Juxilyocypris cf. schwarzbachi, Hungarocypris madaraszi, Darwinula stevensoni, and Mixtacandona sp. Although the lake had not formed at this time, it is well known that the living environment of most ostracod species is connected to flooded plains, marshes, rivers, springs, and interstitial waters. In the deepest and oldest sediments within the core, from depths between 1101 cm and 945 cm, the presence of C. neglecta and J. cf. schwarzbachi are indicative of cold water, while the dominant taxa at depths between 945 cm and 874 cm are the brackish species Cyprideis torosa and C. angulata, possibly suggesting the influence of seawater because of the presence of a permeable karstic ridge that separates the lake from the ocean. In contrast, the dominant ostracod taxa at depths between 874 cm and 813 cm are species typical of freshwater environments subject to colder climatic conditions indicating a marshy, low-energy wetland. We know that the first permanent freshwater body formed at about 8130 cal yr BP (a depth of 813 cm), while large proportions of Pseudocandona marchica, Heterocypris salina, D. stevensoni, and Metacypris cordata are all indicative of warmer, shallow waters that are rich in vegetation and have variable water level. Similarly, from 5240 cal yr BP onwards, a marine influence within the core is evidenced by the presence of Cy. torosa, while present lake water conditions (i.e., alternating seasonal changes in salinity from freshwater to brackish) were established by 2750 cal yr BP. The ostracod assemblages in sediments from Lake Vrana in Dalmatia have significant potential for reconstructing the evolution of this lake as well as for understanding environmental changes and rising sea level.\nMesozoic strata in the East Malaya Terrane of Peninsular Malaysia record a long but poorly constrained history of basin evolution. In this study, we report LA-ICP-MS U-Pb geochronology analyses of detrital zircons in the continental Mesozoic sequences from the Bertangga and Gerek formations of Peninsular Malaysia, with the aim to constrain the depositional ages and provenances of the continental Mesozoic strata as well as the Mesozoic tectonic evolution of the East Malaya Terrane. The Bertangga Formation yields populations of U-Pb zircon ages of Jurassic (139 to 194 Ma), Permo-Triassic (226 to 274 Ma), Ordovician-Devonian (372 to 459 Ma), Neoproterozoic (631 to 876 Ma), and Mesoproterozoic-Palaeoproterozoic (1,448 to 2,629 Ma). In contrast, the Gerek Formation yields significant Carboniferous grains, but with an approximate zircon age range relative to the Bertangga Formation. The new data indicate a maximum Late Jurassic depositional age for the previously undated Bertangga Formation. Similarly, young zircon grain ages in the Gerek Formation also indicate a maximum Late Jurassic depositional age. Collectively, these results on detrital zircons correlate well with a regional tectonic uplift and erosion to a tectonic stability of the East Malaya Terrane basin during the Mesozoic.\nThis study presents zircon U-Pb ages and geochemical and Sr-Nd isotopic data for acid granites from the Uliastai continental margin, which is located in the Ulaan Tolgoi area of the south-eastern Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB). Although most samples have similar calc-alkaline (K2O/Na2O = 0.55-1.70, average of 1.35) and peraluminous (A/CNK = 1.02-1.20 and A/NK = 1.09-1.87) characteristics, the granodiorites, monzogranites, and alkali feldspar granites exhibit distinct light rare earth element (LREE)/heavy REE (HREE) anomalies, including negative Nb, P, Ti, Sr, and Ba anomalies and negative εNd(t) values. These characteristics indicate that this complex massif comprises lower Early Carboniferous subduction-related calc-alkaline granodiorites (348 ± 1 Ma); an upper Early Carboniferous syn-collisional segment characterized by S-type, high-K, calc-alkaline, and peraluminous monzonitic granites (334 ± 1 Ma); and Late Carboniferous post-orogenic extensional A2-type peraluminous alkali feldspar granites (317 ± 1 Ma). Previous studies performed on coeval volcanic rocks and Early Palaeozoic granites in the same area have demonstrated that the Early Carboniferous granodiorites have the same geochemical characteristics as volcanic arc granites (VAGs), thus indicating that the northward subduction of the Hegenshan Ocean may have continued through the Early Carboniferous. The monzogranite and alkali feldspar granites, in conjunction with the Late Carboniferous lagged arc volcanic rocks observed in this area, suggest a syn-collisional to post-collisional setting. The new data presented in this study provide constraints on the timing of the transition from island-arc magmatism to post-collisional extension-related magmatism in this region during the later stage of the Early Carboniferous.\nThe evolution of relict fore-arc basins and their kinematic relationships with sedimentation is often less well understood due their fragmentation or amalgamation of individual basins and continental units by the subsequent collision or other post-orogenic deformation. One example is the Cretaceous-Paleogene closure and associated sedimentation of the Neotethys Ocean that was located between the European and Adriatic continental units. Our combined structural, lithostratigraphic and sedimentological study in the NE Dinarides of Serbia demonstrates a variable Cretaceous fore-arc deposition on the European plate that correlates with the shallow- to deep-water sedimentation over the subducting Adriatic margin. The fore-arc was affected by an initial Early Cretaceous-Cenomanian period of contraction, followed by Turonian-Santonian extension, the basin being exhumed by contraction during the latest Cretaceous-Early Paleogene collision. The collisional geometry was subsequently fragmented by structures associated with the Neogene evolution of the Pannonian Basin. The correlation with the preserved amount and depositional character of Cretaceous trench sediments documents an interplay between subduction accretion and subduction erosion associated with external tectonic forcing, slab retreat and back arc extension.\nTopic 8:\nsoil fractur climat chang\nChanges in natural rainfall regimes have taken place and are expected to become more pronounced in future decades. These changes are also likely to be accompanied by changes in crop management practices. The main purpose of this study was to analyze runoff and soil loss in relation to rainfall regimes and terracing in the Three Gorges area, China. Based on 10 years of field observation and k-mean clusters, 101 rainfall events were grouped into three rainfall regimes. Rainfall regime I was the group of events with strong rainfall intensity, high frequency, and short duration. Rainfall regime III consisted of events with low intensity, long duration, and high rainfall amount. Rainfall regime II was the aggregation of events of high intensity and amount, and less frequent occurrence. The results showed that event runoff coefficients were not significantly different among rainfall regimes. However, the average soil erosion rates in rainfall regimes I and II were significantly higher than that in regime III. The average erosion rates under rainfall regimes I, II, and III were 21.6, 39.7, and 9.8 g m−2, respectively. The effect of rainfall regime on soil erosion also was changed by terracing. On unterraced cropland, soil erosion rate in rainfall regime I is significantly higher than that in regime III. However, the situation did not exist in unterraced orchard. Terracing significantly reduced runoff and soil erosion, and compensated the effects of rainfall regime on soil erosion, which indicated that runoff and erosion in terraced system may be little influenced by climate change. Based on these results, it was suggested more attention should be paid to the timing of rainfall events in relation to crop development and the high erosion on unterraced citrus orchard to control soil erosion in this area.\nAim: Climate tends to explain phenological variations in tropical ecosystems. However, water availability and nutrient content in soil strongly affect plant communities, especially those on old, climatically buffered, infertile landscapes (OCBILs), and may impact these ecosystems' plant reproductive phenology over time. Here, we compare the reproductive phenology of sandy and stony tropical grasslands, two co-occurring herbaceous communities of the campo rupestreOCBILs. We asked whether flowering, fruiting and dispersal are seasonal in both grasslands, and whether these phenophases differ due to variations in soil properties. We also asked whether the phenological strategies and the number of flowers and fruits differ between these two grasslands as soil conditions vary. Location: Serra do Cipó, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Methods: The phenology of herbaceous species of sandy and stony grasslands was monitored monthly over two consecutive years. Results: Plants on sandy and stony grasslands flowered and fruited throughout the year. We did not find a distinct seasonal pattern at the community level of either studied grassland. However, flowering, fruiting and seed dissemination occurred in stony grasslands mainly during the rainy season, while sandy grassland species flowered in both seasons and fruited and disseminated seed mainly during the dry season, as observed in other savanna vegetation types in the Cerrado. Flower and fruit production was higher in sandy grasslands than in stony grasslands, which may be linked to higher water retention in sandy grassland soils. In both communities, species of Cyperaceae, Eriocaulaceae and Xyridaceae contributed most to overall production, whereas Poaceae and Velloziaceae, two important families in campo rupestre, barely participated in the reproductive phenology during our 2-yr survey. Conclusions: Despite a strong seasonal climate, there was no reproductive seasonal pattern at the community level in campo rupestre. This first investigation of Neotropical grassland phenology indicates that the differences in soil content may constrain the grassland reproductive phenology and restrict reproduction of stony grassland species to the most favourable season. Further studies of grassland phenology are necessary to disentangle the relative importance of soil, climate and other triggers, especially fire.\nCreep rupture is investigated at 800 °C of a joint between a glass-ceramic sealant and a ferritic stainless steel interconnect coated with lanthanum strontium manganite for solid oxide fuel cell application. Results reveal the shear and tensile creep strength of the as-joined, non-aged joint at a rupture time of 1000 h is about 42% and 3% of the average shear and tensile bonding strength, respectively. A thermal aging of 1000 h at 800 °C enhances the creep strength. For both non-aged shear and tensile specimens with a short creep rupture time, fracture mainly takes place in an oxyapatite interlayer which is formed in the joining process. For a medium creep rupture time, fracture site changes to a mixed BaCrO4/oxyapatite layer. Oxyapatite and BaCrO4 dominate the creep failure mechanism for 1000 h-aged shear specimens, while (Cr,Mn)3O4 spinel plays a role in the creep failure of 1000 h-aged tensile specimens.\nAccurately estimating the surface fluxes of over the heterogeneous land surface in Tibetan Plateau will be helpful to advance the understanding of its influence on regional climate and hydrology. This paper presents a study on the spatial heterogeneity of land surface parameters in terms of the spatial variability and spatial structure of land surface parameters and the influence on surface fluxes over a typical land surface in Tibetan Plateau. The results suggest that the sensible heat fluxes (H) and latent heat fluxes (LE) in the study area in the rain and dry seasons show apparent spatial variabilities due to the spatial heterogeneity in the leaf area index (LAI) and land surface undulations. The relative frequency distribution of H and LE at the spatial resolution of 30 m suggests that the spatial variability of surface fluxes has a close relationship with the spatial heterogeneity of land surface temperature (LST) and LAI. The variogram analyses of LST, LAI, H, and LE in the study area in rain season indicate that the spatial structures of LST and LAI are different and the spatial structures of H and LE are strongly influenced by the spatial structures of LST and LAI in both rain and dry seasons. The optimal pixel sizes for LST, LAI, H, and LE in the study area are 506, 156, 500, and 225 m in the rain season. The optimal pixel sizes for LST, H, and LE in the study area are 165, 165, and 162 m in the dry season. An analysis of the relative frequency distributions (RFDs) of the LST, LAI, H, and LE at different spatial resolutions in the rain and dry seasons reveals that their values at the maximum relative frequency keep stable although their spatial variabilities become weak as the spatial resolution decreases. The averages of LST, LAI, H, and LE of different spatial resolutions of the study area in rain and dry seasons vary within small ranges, suggesting that the influence of spatial resolution on the averaged land surface parameters and surface fluxes in the study area is small. This work will be helpful for the accurate estimation of the surface fluxes over a large heterogeneous land surface for regional climate modeling in Tibetan Plateau.\nTopic 9:\nuse high result effect\nPolycrystalline cubic boron nitride (PCBN) has outstanding properties in terms of hardness and chemical stability at elevated temperatures. Therefore, PCBN is used in cutting tool materials for hard machining applications e.g. hard turning of hardened steels. Due to the hardness of the workpiece, high forces act on a low contact area between tool and workpiece. Hence, severe thermo-mechanical loadings occur in such applications causing enhanced tool wear. Fundamental knowledge about the material behavior of PCBN-cutting-materials under thermo-mechanical loading is valuable as a basis for a better understanding of tool wear and finally for improvement of tool wear behavior. PCBN-materials are polycrystalline multi-phase compounds with strongly deviating material properties. In order to investigate the phase selective thermo-mechanical behavior of such materials lattice strain measurements are conducted under thermo-mechanical load using in situ X-ray diffraction with high energy synchrotron radiation. A four point bending test set-up and ceramic thermal heaters are used for the application of thermo-mechanical loading. Three different materials are investigated: a solid low PCBN-content material, a low PCBN-content material on a cemented carbide (CC) substrate and a high PCBN-content material on a CC-substrate. The low PCBN-content material exhibits a single phase binder material whereas the high PCBN-content material exhibits a multi-phase binder with up to five phases. Residual stresses are found in the samples with CC-substrate, only. Different phases of one material show different strains but nearly same stresses upon loading. Thus, thermo-mechanical loading can be seen as superposition of the respective mechanical and thermal loads. The space-resolved experimental data is used to validate an analytical model for the calculation of macroscopic stresses. The phase selective space-resolved strain and stress analysis presented in this paper provides a valuable method for the investigation and optimization of hard cutting tool materials and coatings under real cutting conditions.\nIn this study zirconium incorporated Cr3C2-(NiCr) coating has been sprayed on three superalloys viz. Superni 718, Superni 600 and Superco 605 using D-gun technique. A comparative study has been carried out to check the cyclic oxidation in air and hot corrosion in simulated incinerator environment (40%Na2SO4-40%K2SO4-10%NaCl-10%KCl) for the coated specimens at 900°C for 100 cycles. Oxidation kinetics has been established for all the specimens using weight change measurements. Corrosion products have been characterized using X-ray diffractometer (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive analysis (SEM/EDAX). Cr3C2-(NiCr) + 0.2%wtZr coating provides very good corrosion resistance in air oxidation for all the three coated superalloys. As all the three coated superalloys shows parabolic behaviour with parabolic rate constant as 0.07 × 10-10 (g2 cm-4 s-1) for Superni 718, 0.43 × 10-10 (g2 cm-4 s-1) for Superni 600 and 0.3 × 10-10 (g2 cm-4 s-1) for Superco 605 This coating is also effective in the molten salt environment but coating on Co-based superalloy Superco 605 did not perform satisfactorily. The parabolic rate constants for coated Superni 718 is 0.61 × 10-10 (g2 cm-4 s-1), for coated Superni 600 is 6.72 × 10-10 (g2 cm-4 s-1) and for coated Superco 605 is 17.5 × 10-10 (g2 cm-4 s-1).\nFreeze-drying represents a very effective method to significantly prevent loss of nutrients, especially heat-sensitive compounds. Moreover, osmotic dehydration is frequently applied prior to drying in order to facilitate moisture removal and improve quality. In the present study, the effect of osmotic pre-treatment combined with freeze-drying at different working pressures on microstructure, colour, and functional properties such as carotenoid contents, total phenolic contents (TP) and antioxidant activity in papayas was investigated. Osmotic pretreatment prior to freeze-drying resulted in increased yellowness, apparent density, and solid density, while carotenoids, TP, and antioxidant activity were lower compared to untreated samples. SEM images clearly showed that the effect of working pressure on the characteristic of dried papaya structure. Samples dried at working pressure of 9 and 77 kPa showed higher deformation with large cavities and dense dry layer when compared with those at 28 kPa. In addition, samples were significantly higher in lightness, redness, colour difference, and porosity when the working pressure was applied at 9 kPa. A reduction of working pressure had a negative effect on the retention of carotenoids, TP, and antioxidant activity in freeze-dried samples. It can be concluded that 28 kPa of pressure better conserved bioactive compounds and minimised structural deformation.\nThis paper presents experimental measurement methods for the determination and evaluation of process related thermal residual stresses in fiber metal laminates. A cure monitoring system with fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors is used to measure the in-plane strains during processing of carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP)-steel laminates. The simultaneous measurement captures the thermal expansion during the heating stages, the cure shrinkage, and the cooling thermal shrinkage. The results enable the characterization of the co-cure bonding process and the stress transfer between the metal and FRP-layers during the creation process. The residual strains, which are used for calculation of the residual stresses, are recorded at room temperature after manufacturing. In addition, an advanced method using FBG-sensors and the deflection of asymmetric hybrid specimens is developed to validate the gained residual stress data. Asymmetrical specimens are created by removing selected layers after cure. Quantitative evaluation is achieved by determination of their curvature and measuring the strain changes with the embedded FBG-sensors. For validation, the methods were successfully demonstrated on two different curing cycles with different resulting residual stress levels. The simultaneous strain measurement enables the investigation of stress development and delivers more in-depth process knowledge for further optimization of the manufacturing process.\nTopic 10:\nfilm nanoparticl electron electrod\nAll the compositions in the (1−x)Mg0.95Ni0.05Ti0.98Zr0.02O3−xCa0.6La0.8/3TiO3 (0 ⩽ x ⩽ 0.2) series were fabricated using solid state sintering route. Mg0.95Ni0.05Ti0.98Zr0.02O3 possessed excellent microwave dielectric properties with εr ≈ 17.1, Quf0 ≈ 195855 GHz, and τf ≈ −46 ppm/°C. τf was tuned through zero by mixing with Ca0.6La0.8/3TiO3. In the present study, τf ≈ −2 ppm/°C with εr ≈ 23.9 and high Quf0 ≈ 115870 GHz was achieved for x = 0.15, i.e., for a mixture of 85% Mg0.95Ni0.05Ti0.98Zr0.02O3 and 15% Ca0.6La0.8/3TiO3.\nThis paper reports the fabrication of non-enzymatic acetylcholine (ACh) electrochemical sensor based on low energy nitrogen ion (100 keV) implanted tungsten trioxide (WO3) thin films modified indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode. The WO3 thin films deposited on ITO by spin coating technique was subjected to nitrogen ion implantation with the optimum fluence of 1 × 1015 ions/cm2. The implanted electrode was characterized by X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), photoluminescence spectra, Hall Effect measurements, cyclic voltammetry and amperometry. The implanted WO3 modified ITO electrode induces desirable changes in the crystal structure, surface morphology and electron mobility. Compared with pristine WO3/ITO, nitrogen ion implanted WO3/ITO displayed improved electrical conductivity and electrocatalytic activity towards ACh oxidation in 0.1 M potassium hydroxide solution (KOH). Amperometric measurements showed that the fabricated electrode had a wide linear response range of 0.1-8000 μM, higher sensitivity of 140.57 ± 0.62 mA/M/cm2 and the lowest detection limit of 28 nM, which are superior among the non-enzymatic ACh electrochemical sensors. The proposed sensor exhibits an excellent anti-interferential ability, good stability and reproducibility and successfully applied for the determination of ACh levels in human serum samples.\nCuO hollow microspheres had been batch synthesized by a facile route of precipitating and annealing at 270 °C, which was derived from CuSO4·5H2O, Na2CO3 and CTAB. The morphology and structure of synthesized CuO powder were characterized by XRD, SEM, UV–Vis and BET. The formation mechanism of CuO hollow microspheres had been proposed based on the characterized structure and morphology. Firstly, the tiny Cu2(OH)2CO3 crystal strips are formed from CuSO4 and Na2CO3 aqueous solutions. Secondly, the tiny Cu2(OH)2CO3 crystal strips are assembled perpendicularly to the spherical CTA+ micelles surface due to the template of CTAB. Finally, the CuO hollow microspheres have been obtained due to the decomposition of Cu2(OH)2CO3 and burning of CTAB after annealing at 270 °C. High gas sensitivity to ethanol was achieved for the CuO hollow microspheres. The response of CuO hollow microspheres sensor is 5.6 to ethanol with the concentration of 400 ppm at 250 °C, and the responses/recover time is 17.0/11.9 s. Therefore, it indicates that the facile and batch route is a promising method to synthesize CuO hollow microspheres with excellent gas sensing properties.\nWe aimed at enhancing interaction in the polyimide/sepiolite hybrid films with the loading of sepiolite in the polyimide matrix ranged from 0 to 8 wt% via acid activating and polydopamine doping. First, sepiolite was treated with a 3M HCl solution under reflux conditions. Then the acid-activated sepiolite was coated by mussel-inspired polydopamine under alkaline conditions. The coated polydopamine was found to successfully enhance dispersibility of sepiolite in the polyimide matrix. The modification of the sepiolite in the hybrid films was investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, wide-angle X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, and transmission electron microscope. The results indicated that polydopamine coating could increase interaction between the polyimide matrix and sepiolite.\nTopic 11:\nmutat food symptom depress\nBackground: Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) neuropathies represent the most common forms of inherited polyneuropathies. CMT2A, the axonal form, accounts for about one third of all CMT cases. Variants in the MFN2 gene have been recognized to be a major cause of CMT2A. To date, more than 100 pathogenetic mutations in MFN2 have been identified, leading to different neurological clinical spectrum, varying from hereditary neuropathies to more severe clinical phenotypes. Pathogenic variants in MFN2 mainly act in a dominant manner, although in a few sporadic or familial cases, homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations have been reported. Results: We describe a child carrying a novel homozygous MFN2 mutation leading to an early-onset sensorimotor axonal neuropathy with an atypical and severe phenotype. Conclusion: The case highlights a very rare mechanism of inheritance for MFN2 mutations and expands the clinical and allelic variance of severe CMT2A phenotype. Moreover, it proposes the involvement of cerebellar peduncles observed at neuroimaging as a novel clue to suspect the diagnosis and address genetic testing.\nFood-protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES) is an increasingly common form of non-IgE-mediated food allergy. Different phenotypes are possible, acute or chronic, with sub-phenotypes. FPIES manifested only by diarrhea can also occur. The incriminated food is primarily cow's milk but unusual food allergies are occasionally observed. The distribution of incriminated foods varies according to the different continents.\nDespite clinical observation of perfectionistic tendencies among youth with chronic pain and their parents as well as established relationships between perfectionism and functional somatic symptoms in adults and youth, no research in the pediatric pain literature has examined perfectionism. This study explored the role of various types of youth and parent perfectionism on youth and parent pain-related distress and behavior and youth pain-related dysfunction. At admission, 239 parent-child pairs from outpatient and day-treatment rehabilitation settings completed several questionnaires assessing perfectionism, pain-related distress, and pain-related dysfunction. Bivariate correlations indicated that socially prescribed perfectionism in youth and parents was linked to youth pain duration, parent and youth pain-related distress and behavior, and youth somatization. Indirect relations showed that youth socially prescribed perfectionism was the only form of perfectionism directly associated with youth somatization whereas all forms of youth perfectionism were indirectly associated with somatization and functional disability through increases in youth pain-related fear and catastrophizing. Additionally, socially prescribed perfectionism was the only type of parent perfectionism linked to youth pain-related dysfunction (somatization, functional disability) through its association with youth pain-related fear. Findings support clinical observations that parent and youth perfectionism is a psychosocial factor that should be targeted in pediatric chronic pain treatment. Perspective: Perfectionism in youth with chronic pain and their parents was indirectly linked to youth pain-related dysfunction through its effect on youth pain-related catastrophizing and fear. Findings support clinical observations that parent and youth perfectionism is a psychosocial factor that should be targeted in pediatric chronic pain treatment.\nIntroduction: Childhood sexual abuse (CSA) has been identified as a potent risk factor for sexual dysfunction. Certain characteristics of the abuse experience, such as repeated abuse, appear to affect the risk of developing sexual dysfunction. Despite the robust findings that CSA can be detrimental to sexual function, there is little consensus on the exact mechanisms that lead to these difficulties. Aim: To summarize the most up-to-date research on the relation between CSA and women's sexual function. Methods: The published literature examining the prevalence of sexual dysfunction among women with CSA histories, various types of sexual dysfunctions, and mechanisms proposed to explain the relation between CSA and later sexual difficulties was reviewed. Main Outcome Measures: Review of peer-reviewed literature. Results: Women with abuse histories report higher rates of sexual dysfunction compared with their non-abused peers. The sexual concerns most commonly reported by women with abuse histories include problems with sexual desire and sexual arousal. Mechanisms that have been proposed to explain the relation between CSA and sexual dysfunction include cognitive associations with sexuality, sexual self-schemas, sympathetic nervous system activation, body image and esteem, and shame and guilt. Conclusion: Women with CSA histories represent a unique population in the sexual health literature. Review of mechanisms proposed to account for the relation between CSA and sexual health suggests that a lack of positive emotions related to sexuality, rather than greater negative emotions, appears to be more relevant to the sexual health of women with CSA histories. Treatment research has indicated that mindfulness-based sex therapy and expressive writing treatments are particularly effective for this group. Further research is needed to clarify the mechanisms that lead to sexual dysfunction for women with abuse histories to provide more targeted treatments for sexual dysfunction among women with abuse histories.

Sex Med Rev 2018;X:XXX-XXX.\nTopic 12:\nvaccin perovskit virus coal\nAvian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC), a leading cause of avian airsacculitis and colibacillosis, is responsible for significant economic loss in the poultry industry. APEC serogroups O1, O2, and O78 are predominantly associated with disease. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) O-antigen has been shown to be a potent antigen for inducing specific protective immune responses. Therefore, we sought to develop a multivalent polysaccharide vaccine to prevent most APEC infections. We previously reported the stable expression of plasmid pSS27 encoding the APEC O1 O-antigen gene cluster (10.8 kb) in attenuated Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium S740 provided excellent protection against APEC O1 challenge. In this study, the plasmid pSS28 harboring the APEC O2 O-antigen polysaccharide gene cluster (15.5 kb) was constructed. Biosynthesis of pSS28-encoded APEC O2 O-antigen in Salmonella vaccine strain S740 was validated by Western blot. The recombinant Salmonella vaccine strain S740 (pSS28) elicited homologous protection against virulent wild-type APEC O2 challenge in a chicken model. Furthermore, through equal-volume mixing the two monovalent vaccine strains S740 (pSS27) and S740 (pSS28), a bivalent vaccine candidate against both APEC O1 and O2 was developed. Immunization of chickens with the bivalent vaccine elicited production of serum IgG and mucosal sIgA antibodies against the LPS of both APEC O1 and O2. Moreover, antibodies induced by the bivalent vaccine promoted opsonization, provoked complement-mediated bactericidal activity, and elicited protection against lethal challenge with both virulent APEC O1 and O2 strains. These results demonstrate that the bivalent vaccine comprised of S740 (pSS27) and S740 (pSS28) is a promising vaccine candidate against APEC O1 and O2 infection.\nBackground: Ghana introduced the monovalent rotavirus vaccine (Rotarix) into its national paediatric vaccination programme in May2012. Vaccine introduction was initiated nationwide and achieved >85% coverage within a few months. Rotavirus strain distribution pre- and post-RV vaccine introduction is reported. Methods: Stool samples were collected from diarrhoeic children <5 years of age hospitalized between 2009 and 2016 at sentinel sites across Ghana and analyzed for the presence of group A rotavirus by enzyme immunoassay. Rotavirus strains were characterized by RT-PCR and sequencing. Results: A total of 1363 rotavirus EIA-positive samples were subjected to molecular characterization. These were made up of 823 (60.4%) and 540 (39.6%) samples from the pre- and post-vaccine periods respectively. Rotavirus VP7 genotypes G1, G2 and G3, and VP4 genotypes P[6] and P[8] constituted more than 65% of circulating G and P types in the pre-vaccine period. The common strains detected were G1P[8] (20%), G3P[6] (9.2%) and G2P[6] (4.9%).During the post-vaccine period, G12, G1 and G10 genotypes, constituted more than 65% of the VP7 genotypes whilst P[6] and P[8] made up more than 75% of the VP4 genotypes. The predominant circulating strains were G12P[8] (26%), G10P[6] (10%) G3P[6] (8.1%) and G1P[8] (8.0%). We also observed the emergence of the unusual rotavirus strain G9P[4] during this period. Conclusion: Rotavirus G1P[8], the major strain in circulation during the pre-vaccination era, was replaced by G12P[8] as the most predominant strain after vaccine introduction. This strain replacement could be temporary and unrelated to vaccine introduction since an increase in G12 was observed in countries yet to introduce the rotavirus vaccine in West Africa. A continuous surveillance programme in the post-vaccine era is necessary for the monitoring of circulating rotavirus strains and the detection of unusual/emerging genotypes.\nThe author’s affiliation should read Samara National Research University named after Academician S.

Solanaceous crops such as tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) and tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) are salt sensitive and naturally GB non-accumulators. In Solanaceae, only the Lycium genus has been recorded as halophytes in China, and several Lycium species have been reported as GB accumulators. The last biosynthetic step of GB is catalyzed by aminoaldehyde dehydrogenase (AMADH) with betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase (BADH) activities. Failure of GB synthesis in tomato and tobacco was attributed to lack of BADH activity. Here, by comparing the BADH functional residues of AMADHs between the Lycium genus and solanaceous crops, we predict that all studied AMADH1s have low BADH activities while only LbAMADH2 from L. barbarum has high BADH activity. For two AMADHs in L. ruthenicum, results from substrate enzyme assays confirmed low BADH activity of LrAMADH1 and no BADH activity of LrAMADH2. Despite the very low GB contents in L. ruthenicum seedlings (< 0.5 μmol g-1 fresh weight), GB contents in fruits are up to 150μmol g-1 FW, inferring fruits of L. ruthenicum as good GB sources. In NaCl treated seedlings, accompanied by elevated GB accumulation, expression of LrAMADH1 was up-regulated, indicating response of LrAMADH1 to salt stress in L. ruthenicum. Virus-induced silence of LrAMADH1 leads to less GB accumulation than control, revealing that LrAMADH1 participates in GB synthesis in planta. Collectively, our results show that LrAMADH1 is the bona fide BADH, which responds to salt stress in L. ruthenicum.\nTopic 13:\npatient group studi signific\nPrimary mucosal melanoma is a rare, aggressive neoplasm and there is limited data in Asian. We aim is to describe the clinicopathologic features and to evaluate overall survival rate (OS). We reviewed 17 cases over a 10-year period. The mean age was 60.9 ± 14.8 with 94.1% being female. The female genital tract was the principal location (52.9%). The most presenting symptoms were masses (88.2%), with 44.1% being amelanotic melanoma. The majority of patients (41.2%) had TNM stage IV. The median OS was 19.5 months, whilst the 1- and 3-year OS were; 70.6% (95% CI, 51.9-95.9%) and 9.8% (95% CI, 1.6-59.5%), respectively.\nBackground: Mesalazine 1 g suppository/die is used for mild to moderately active ulcerative proctitis (UP). Whether addiction of Multi Matrix System (MMX) mesalazine increases the remission rate of UP and prevents proximal extension of disease is unknown. Methods: This is a retrospective study on 116 outpatients with UP who had been treated with one of the following regimens: (1) MMX mesalazine 1.2 g/die plus mesalazine suppositories for 8 ± 2 weeks and, subsequently, MMX mesalazine 1.2 g/die plus rectal mesalazine 1 g every other day for at least 6 months; (2) mesalazine 1 g suppositories/die alone for 8 ± 2 weeks and, subsequently, rectal mesalazine 1 g every other day for 6 more months. Patients were evaluated clinically at 2 months (±2 weeks) and endoscopically at 6 months (±2 weeks). For categorical variables, Pearson chi-square test was used. Results: A total of 46 of 55 patients (84%) on combined therapy and 49 of 61 patients (80%) on rectal mesalazine reached clinical remission (p > 0.05; OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.30–2.07). At 6 months follow-up, proximal extension of disease was observed in 7 of 55 (14%) patients on combined therapy and in 18 of 61 (29%) patients on rectal mesalazine alone (p < 0.05; OR 2.87, 95% CI 1.09–7.53). Conclusions: Oral MMX mesalazine plus rectal mesalazine combined treatment is associated with prevention of proximal extension of the disease compared with rectal mesalazine alone.\nBackground: Direct catheter-based thrombectomy (d-CBT) was proven to be an effective treatment for proximal occlusions of the major intracranial arteries in acute stroke patients. The aim of this study was to compare clinical outcomes of patients treated by d-CBT depending on their baseline characteristics. Methods: A single center, prospective, observational registry of consecutive patients (pts) treated by d-CBT for an acute ischemic stroke. The degree of dependence after a stroke was measured by the modified Rankin scale (mRS) at 3 months follow-up and pts were divided into 2 subgroups based on functional independence/dependence (mRS 0-2 vs. 3-6). Results: A total of 111 consecutive patients (mean age 65.9 ys, men 55%) have been enrolled. A favorable outcome (mRS. ≤. 2 at 3 months) was reached in 39.8% (44. pts). The pts with favorable outcome (mRS. ≤. 2) compared to pts with poor outcome (mRS 3-6) were younger (61 ys vs. 70 ys, p <. 0.01), had higher prevalence of cigarette smoking (45.5% vs. 25.4%, p <. 0.002) and had lower prevalence of known atrial fibrilation (25% vs. 53.7%, p <. 0.001). There were no significant differences between the subgroups in: sex (men 50% vs. 58%, p = 0.27), body mass index (27.8 vs. 29.2, p = 21), arterial hypertension (70.5% vs. 77.6%, p = 0.26), diabetes mellitus (15.9% vs. 25.4%, p = 15), chronic kidney disease (11.4% vs. 22.4%, p = 0.08) and NIHSS on admission (15 vs. 18, p = 0.69). Conclusions: Mechanical thrombectomy achieved better clinical results in younger patients, in smokers and in patients with stroke not caused by atrial fibrillation.\nPurpose: To evaluate the impact of timing of blood transfusion in patients with upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) treated with radical nephroureterectomy (RNU). Methods: Outcomes of consecutive patients with UTUC treated with RNU were analyzed. Clinicopathologic factors were compared using Fisher’s exact test or the Wilcoxon rank-sum test between patients who received any transfusion and no transfusion, and between patients receiving intraoperative transfusion only and patients receiving no transfusion. Cancer-specific and overall survival were estimated and multivariable analyses were performed to assess the impact of timing of transfusion on clinical outcomes. Results: Among 402 patients included in this study, 71 (17.6%) patients received a transfusion at any point and 27 (6.7%) patients received an intraoperative blood transfusion. Transfusion at any time, patient comorbidity, high grade, advanced stage, positive surgical margins, low preoperative hemoglobin, longer operative duration, and increased blood loss were significantly associated with cancer-specific survival (DSS) on univariable analysis (HR 1.85, 95% CI 1.20–2.85, p < 0.005). In the multivariable analysis, transfusion at any point was not a prognostic factor (HR 1.00, 95% CI 0.60–1.68, p = 0.99). When examining intraoperatively transfusion only, transfusion was significantly associated with DSS (HR 1.91, 95% CI 1.01–3.59, p = 0.045) but no longer significant in multivariable analysis (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.32–1.65, p = 0.440). Conclusions: Our study indicates that the administration of blood transfusion either intraoperatively or postoperatively is not associated with clinical or oncological outcomes in patients with upper tract urothelial carcinoma when adjusted for other factors in multivariable analysis. Further study is required.\nTopic 14:\nreaction acid catalyst activ\nIntermolecular C-H alkylation of simple arenes in the presence of an iron catalyst has been achieved in a cascade manner with an aminative cyclization triggered by N-O bond cleavage of an alkene-tethered oxime ester. Various arenes, including electron-rich and electron-poor arenes, and heteroarenes can be employed in the reaction system. Regioselectivity and radical trapping experiments support the involvement of alkyl radical species, which undergo a homolytic aromatic substitution (HAS) to afford the arylation products.\nReaction of O-trimethylsilyl (O-TMS) derivatives of α-dimethylamino ketones with chloro(chloromethyl)dimethylsilane led to the formation of six-membered heterocyclic compounds with tetracoordinated silicon atom - 3,4-dihydro-2H-1,4,2-oxazasilin-4-ium chlorides. The exchange reactions of 2,2,4,4-tetramethyl-6-phenyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-1,4,2-oxazasilin-4-ium chloride were examined with Me3SiI and NaBPh4 and the corresponding iodide or tetraphenylborate of 2,2,4,4-tetramethyl-6-phenyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-1,4,2-oxazasilin-4-ium were isolated. 2,2,4,4-Tetramethyl-6-phenyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-1,4,2-oxazasilin-4-ium chloride easy reacts with MeOH to give N-((methoxydimethylsilyl)methyl)-N,N-dimethyl-2-oxo-2-phenylethanaminium chloride. The structure of synthesized compounds 10-15 was proved by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, 11 was also characterised by X-ray crystallography.\nReported is an unprecedented catalytic enantioselective desymmetrizing aza-Wacker reaction. In the presence of a catalytic amount of a newly developed Pd(CPA)2(MeCN)2 catalyst (CPA=chiral phosphoric acid), a pyrox ligand, and molecular oxygen, cyclization of properly functionalized prochiral 3,3-disubstituted cyclohexa-1,4-dienes afforded enantioenriched cis-3a-substituted tetrahydroindoles in good yields with excellent enantioselectivities. A cooperative effect between the phosphoric acid and the pyrox ligand ensured efficient transformation. This reaction was tailor-made for Amaryllidaceae and Sceletium alkaloids as illustrated by its application in the development of the concise and divergent total synthesis of (-)-mesembrane and (+)-crinane.\nThe phosphorus analogues of cyclopentadienone, tricyclopentanone, and housene were accessed from bis(cyclopropenyl)diphosphetanedione 3, which was prepared by mixing 1,2,3-tris-tert-butylcyclopropenium tetrafluoroborate (1) and sodium phosphaethynolate [Na(OCP)(dioxane)n]. While photolysis of 3 results in decarbonylation, yielding bis(cyclopropenyl)diphosphene 4 and after rearrangement diphosphahousene 5, thermolysis of 3 leads to phosphatricyclo[2.1.0.0]pentanone 7. Metal-mediated valence isomerization of 7 and subsequent demetalation provides access to phosphacyclopentadienone 12.\n"
