# TopicModelingUsingLDA #

## Overview ##
We explored topic modeling with a sample size of 7000 abstracts from scientific articles. The objective was to reduce abstract paragraphs 
into bag of words and then create a vector to their corresponding document. From there we generated a statistical model using LDA which gave us two vectors; words to topic, document to topic. We then visualized the model with pyLDAvis.

## Libraries used ##
* Natural Language Toolkit - Stemmer
* Beautiful Soup - XML extraction tool
* Scikit Learn - Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Count Vectorizer
* pyLDAvis - Visualization
